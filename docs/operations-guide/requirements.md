# Requirements

## Hardware sizing

Postmill is a Node.js application backed by Postgres and Redis. Background jobs are handled by
Inngest Cloud, so self-hosted deployments no longer need a local workflow engine.

| Tier      | Users  | CPU  | RAM    | Disk   | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Minimum   | 1-5    | 2 vCPU | 4 GB  | 20 GB  | Suitable for single-tenant or small teams |
| Small     | 5-50   | 4 vCPU | 8 GB  | 50 GB  | Comfortable for most self-hosters |
| Medium    | 50-200 | 8 vCPU | 16 GB | 100 GB | Add RAM for analytics cache / large orgs |
| Large     | 200+   | 16 vCPU+ | 32 GB+ | 200 GB+ | Scale Postgres and Redis independently |

The heavy pieces:
- **PostgreSQL 17** — the application database is typically modest (< 5 GB for small instances),
  but grows with analytics snapshots and media metadata.
- **Redis 7** — negligible memory (< 100 MB) unless analytics cache loads dozens of orgs.
- **Inngest Cloud** — background jobs run in Inngest; no local Temporal/Elasticsearch services are
  required.

## Software prerequisites

### Build toolchain

| Tool      | Required version    | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Node.js   | `>=22.12.0 <23.0.0` | See `engines` in `package.json` |
| pnpm      | `10.6.1`            | Specified in `packageManager`; other versions may silently break |
| Docker    | Recent stable       | Only needed for Docker Compose deployment |
| git       | Any                 | For cloning the repository |

### Runtime dependencies

| Software              | Version     | Role |
|-----------------------|-------------|------|
| PostgreSQL            | 17          | Application data |
| Redis                 | 7.2         | Session cache, throttle store, analytics cache |
| Inngest Cloud         | —           | Durable background jobs (analytics, comments, publish, token refresh) |
| Email provider (optional) | —           | 6-provider adapter system (Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, Amazon SES, SMTP). Configure with `EMAIL_PROVIDER` + standardized env vars. See [Configuration](./configuration.md#email-v381). |

### Object storage

All media is stored locally by default (`UPLOAD_DIRECTORY`). Cloud providers (S3, R2, B2, IDrive e2)
are configured per-organization via Settings → Storage. Avatars and app-internal writes always use
local storage.

| Provider            | Notes |
|---------------------|-------|
| Local disk          | Default; 5 GB quota per org. Simple but not redundant. |
| Cloudflare R2       | S3-compatible, no egress fees (per-tenant, Settings → Storage) |
| AWS S3              | S3-native API (per-tenant, Settings → Storage) |
| Backblaze B2        | S3-compatible, low storage cost (per-tenant, Settings → Storage) |
| IDrive e2           | S3-compatible (per-tenant, Settings → Storage) |

Storage providers are configured **per-organization** via the Settings UI, not environment
variables. See [Storage Setup](./storage.md) and [Configuration](./configuration.md).

## Network and URL requirements

- The application must be reachable at the URL you set in `FRONTEND_URL`. OAuth redirects from
  social providers resolve against this URL.
- The `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` must be reachable from within the container for internal API calls.
  In Docker Compose, this is `http://localhost:3000`; behind a reverse proxy, set it to the internal
  backend address.
- **Outbound HTTPS** is required — all provider API calls and webhook dispatches go through
  `safeFetch`, which enforces HTTPS and blocks private/internal IPs (unless explicitly allowlisted
  via `SSRF_ALLOWED_PRIVATE_CIDRS` for self-hosted provider instances).
- Ensure your public IP is in the allow-list for any API tokens you create via the Public API
  settings.

## CLI commands

The `apps/commands` package provides NestJS CLI commands for operator tasks:

```bash
# Build the CLI
pnpm run commands:build:development

# Check configuration for issues
npx nestjs-command config:check

# Refresh all OAuth tokens
npx nestjs-command refresh

# Run the AI agent
npx nestjs-command run:agent
```

Run these inside the application container or with the same environment variables as the backend.
