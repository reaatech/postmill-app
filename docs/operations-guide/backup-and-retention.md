# Backup & Retention

Postmill keeps all application state in PostgreSQL and uploaded media on local disk or object storage. Schema changes are applied through committed Prisma migrations (`pnpm run prisma-migrate-deploy`), which is the path used by CI and the production boot sequence. Backups are still essential: rollback is forward-only, and a failed or destructive migration is only recoverable from a snapshot.

## What to back up

### 1. PostgreSQL database

The primary data store. Contains users, organizations, posts, integrations, tokens, analytics snapshots, comments, and all configuration.

```bash
# From the Docker host
docker exec postmill-postgres pg_dump -U postmill-user postmill-db-local > postmill_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Or with a connection string
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > postmill_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

Schedule this daily. Keep at least 7 days of backups.

### 2. Upload directory or object storage

All uploaded media (images, videos, audio). If using local storage, back up the volume:

```bash
# From the Docker host
docker run --rm -v postmill-uploads:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/uploads_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .
```

If using cloud object storage (R2, S3, B2, IDrive e2), enable versioning and/or cross-region replication on the bucket.

### 3. JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY

These secrets encrypt OAuth tokens, AI provider credentials, storage credentials, and other secrets at rest. **If you lose them, every encrypted value in the database becomes unrecoverable.** Store them:

- In a password manager or secrets vault
- In a `.env` file with restricted permissions, outside the backup bundle
- Never in the database backup alone — if you restore to a fresh instance with a different `JWT_SECRET`, all tokens will fail to decrypt

## What not to back up

- **Redis** — cache only; data is rebuilt on restart. AOF/RDB persistence is useful for avoiding cold-cache latency but is not a backup.
- **node_modules** or build artifacts.

## Automated data retention

Postmill prunes and rolls up data through Inngest scheduled functions. You do not need to run manual cleanup queries.

| Data | Default retention | Mechanism | Env var |
|------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Daily `AnalyticsSnapshot` rows | 548 days (~18 months) | Rolled into weekly rows by the analytics collection function | `ANALYTICS_DAILY_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| `PostAnalyticsSnapshot` rows | 90 days | Pruned by the analytics collection function | `ANALYTICS_POST_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Social comments | 90 days | Soft-deleted by the comments collection function | `SOCIAL_COMMENT_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Email log metadata | 90 days | Pruned by the analytics collection function | `EMAIL_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| `Errors` rows | 90 days | Pruned by the retention-purge function | `ERRORS_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Notifications | 180 days | Hard-deleted by the retention-purge function | `NOTIFICATIONS_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Incomplete multipart uploads | 7 days | Hard-deleted by the retention-purge function | `MULTIPART_UPLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Mastra traces/scorers | 30 days | Hard-deleted by the retention-purge function | `MASTRA_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Soft-deleted posts/files | 30 days | Hard-purged by the retention-purge function | `SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| AI Designer chat sessions | 90 days | Hard-deleted by the retention-purge function | `AI_DESIGNER_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| User/Session IP and agent | 90 days | Nulled by the retention-purge function | `IP_RETENTION_DAYS` |

See [Inngest & Cron](./inngest-and-cron.md) for how the functions operate.

## Why backups are critical

Postmill's schema is managed with committed Prisma migrations:

- `pnpm run prisma-migrate-deploy` applies migrations in order and is forward-only.
- Adding a nullable or defaulted column is safe.
- Renaming or dropping a column is destructive and should be done as a contract step in an expand/contract plan.
- The destructive-diff guard (`scripts/schema-destructive-guard.mjs`) rejects `DROP TABLE`/`DROP COLUMN` and `ADD COLUMN … NOT NULL` without a default unless `ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_SCHEMA=true`.

`prisma db push` is for local prototyping only. The `scripts/postmill-migrate.sh` helper wraps `prisma db push` for manual, in-place sync against a running container and warns you to back up before using `--accept-data-loss`. Always back up before any manual schema operation or contract deploy.

## Restore checklist

1. **Stop the application** — prevent write traffic during restore.
2. **Restore Postgres**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -i postmill-postgres psql -U postmill-user postmill-db-local < postmill_20260609.sql
   ```
3. **Restore uploads**:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v postmill-uploads:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/uploads_20260609.tar.gz -C /data
   ```
4. **Verify `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`** match the values from the backup:
   - If you changed `JWT_SECRET` since the backup, all encrypted tokens will fail to decrypt.
   - Test by logging in and checking that connected channels still work.
5. **Start the application** and verify:
   - Users can log in.
   - Channels are connected (no auth errors).
   - Uploaded media is accessible.
   - Inngest functions are registered and scheduled runs appear in the dashboard.
6. **Take a fresh post-restore backup**.

## Backup automation example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# /etc/cron.daily/postmill-backup
set -euo pipefail
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/postmill"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

docker exec postmill-postgres pg_dump -U postmill-user postmill-db-local > "$BACKUP_DIR/db_$DATE.sql"
docker run --rm -v postmill-uploads:/data -v "$BACKUP_DIR":/backup alpine tar czf "/backup/uploads_$DATE.tar.gz" -C /data .

# Keep 7 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name '*.sql' -mtime +7 -delete
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name '*.tar.gz' -mtime +7 -delete
```
