# Plugs

Plugs are automation hooks attached to social channel providers. They allow
providers to define custom actions that run either on a schedule after publish
(auto plugs) or immediately after a post is published (post plugs). Both are
configured in the composer's per-channel settings panel.

## Two plug types

### Auto Plugs (`@Plug` decorator)

Polling-based background jobs that react to analytics or time-based triggers.

Declared with the `@Plug` decorator from `@gitroom/helpers/decorators/plug.decorator`:

```typescript
@Plug({
  identifier: 'republish-top-post',
  title: 'Republish top post',
  description: 'When a post reaches a certain number of likes, republish it',
  runEveryMilliseconds: 3600000,  // How often to check
  totalRuns: 10,                  // Max number of runs (0 = unlimited)
  disabled: false,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'likes',
      description: 'Number of likes threshold',
      type: 'number',
      placeholder: '100',
      validation: /^\d+$/,
    },
  ],
})
```

Parameters:
- `identifier` — unique plug name
- `runEveryMilliseconds` — polling interval
- `totalRuns` — max runs (0 = unlimited)
- `fields` — configuration fields the user fills in the UI

### Internal / Post Plugs (`@PostPlug` decorator)

One-shot actions executed immediately after a post is successfully published.

Declared with the `@PostPlug` decorator from
`@gitroom/helpers/decorators/post.plug.ts`:

```typescript
@PostPlug({
  identifier: 'repost-as-page',
  title: 'Repost as LinkedIn Page',
  description: 'After posting, have your LinkedIn Page repost it',
  pickIntegration: ['linkedin-page'],  // Only show when these providers are connected
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'message',
      description: 'Repost message',
      type: 'text',
      placeholder: 'Check out this post!',
    },
  ],
})
```

Parameters:
- `identifier` — unique plug name
- `pickIntegration` — array of provider identifiers that must be connected for this plug
  to be available
- `fields` — configuration fields

## How plugs work

### Registration

1. Providers declare plugs using `@Plug` or `@PostPlug` decorators on methods.
2. The decorators store metadata on the prototype via `Reflect.defineMetadata`
   (`custom:plug` for auto plugs, `custom:internal_plug` for post plugs).
3. `IntegrationManager.getAllPlugs()` reads this `Reflect` metadata at runtime
   and returns all available plug definitions.
4. The frontend fetches `/integrations/plug/list` to discover available plugs.

### Configuration

Both plug types are configured **in the composer's per-channel settings panel** (there is no
standalone `/plugs` page — it was retired). The panel is shown per selected channel and only surfaces
the plugs that channel's provider actually declares.

**Auto plugs (channel-wide)** — the `ChannelGlobalPlugs` section
(`composer/providers/channel.global.plugs.tsx`):
1. The frontend fetches `/integrations/plug/list` and matches the entry for the channel's provider
   identifier (renders nothing if the provider declares no auto plugs, or the member lacks
   `channels:update`).
2. It fetches `/integrations/:id/plugs` for existing configurations.
3. Configuration is saved via `POST /integrations/:id/plugs` with `PlugDto` and toggled via
   `PUT /integrations/plugs/:id/activate`.
4. Data is stored in the `Plugs` Prisma table, upserted by `(plugFunction, integrationId)` — so the
   config is **channel-wide** and applies to every post that channel publishes.

**Post plugs (per-post)** — the `InternalChannels` section
(`launches/internal.channels.tsx`), fetched from `/integrations/:identifier/internal-plugs`. Its
values are written into the post's `settings` JSON (`plug--<identifier>--*` keys) and travel with that
single post.

### Execution

**Auto Plugs**: During the post workflow, `PostActivity` checks configured plugs.
When conditions are met, the plug handler is called.

**Post Plugs**: Executed by the `post/publish` Inngest function immediately after a successful
`provider.post()`, before the workflow completes. Idempotency comes from Inngest's durable
`step.run` (no `continueAsNew` — the Temporal orchestrator was removed).

## Frontend integration

Both plug surfaces live in the composer's per-channel settings panel
(`composer/providers/high.order.provider.tsx`, portalled into `#social-settings`):
- `composer/providers/channel.global.plugs.tsx` — the channel-wide **auto plugs** section, with
  per-plug cards and a configuration modal built with `react-hook-form` + `yup` validation.
- `launches/internal.channels.tsx` (`InternalChannels`) — the per-post **post plugs** section.

The configuration modal renders fields based on the plug's `fields` definition
(type, placeholder, validation regex).

## Plug data flow

```
Provider @Plug/@PostPlug decorator
  → Reflect metadata ('custom:plug' / 'custom:internal_plug')
    → IntegrationManager.getAllPlugs() reads metadata
      → GET /integrations/plug/list → composer channel-settings panel renders available plugs
      → User configures plug → POST /integrations/:id/plugs
        → Stored in Plugs table (upsert by plugFunction + integrationId)
          → post/publish Inngest function reads plugs during publish
            → Post plugs: run once after provider.post()
            → Auto plugs: scheduled for totalRuns at runEveryMilliseconds
```
