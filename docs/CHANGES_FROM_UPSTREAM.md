# What's Different From Upstream

This fork (**Postmill**) has diverged substantially from
[gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app). The upstream documentation at
`docs.postiz.com` no longer describes how this fork behaves. This page is the canonical summary of
the differences; the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/reaatech/postmill-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) has the full detail per release.

---

## AI at the core

This is an **AI-native** fork. Where upstream ships a single hardcoded OpenAI integration, this fork
runs a governed, multi-provider AI layer under the entire platform: bring your own keys across **25
providers** — 13 direct model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Meta Llama,
Mistral, DeepSeek, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, Qwen, MiniMax, Azure OpenAI) plus 12 multi-model hubs &
gateways (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Together AI, Fireworks AI,
DeepInfra, SiliconFlow, Lightning AI, GMI Cloud, Bitdeer, Vultr) — pick the exact model from an admin
screen, and switch providers everywhere without a redeploy. On top of it: on-brand content generation, smart comment replies,
brand-voice profiles, a shared prompt library, semantic (RAG) search over your own content,
compliance guardrails (prompt-injection / PII / brand-safety / NSFW), and per-org spend caps with a
full audit log — every AI entry point scoped, rate-limited, and budget-checked.

Everything below builds around that foundation.

---

## v3.7.0 — Brand cutover (Postiz → Postmill)

The fork is renamed **Postiz → Postmill**. No application schema changes. The rename rebrands every
user-facing surface and most internal identifiers, and carries several **breaking** infrastructure
renames for self-hosters.

- **Branding** — product name `Postiz` → `Postmill` across UI copy, page titles, emails, OpenAPI,
  and all translation locales; primary brand color `#612bd3` → `#2b5cd3`; logos and the browser
  extension rebranded. The `isGeneralServerSide()`/`isGeneral` "Postiz vs Gitroom" display toggles
  collapse to always render Postmill.
- **Packages & SDK** — workspace names `postiz-*` → `postmill-*` (internal; scripts target by path).
  The Node SDK is republished as **`@reaatech/postmill-sdk`** (was `@postiz/node`).
- **Env vars (BREAKING)** — all `POSTIZ_*` variables hard-renamed to `POSTMILL_*`
  (`POSTMILL_GENERIC_OAUTH`, `POSTMILL_OAUTH_*`, `POSTMILL_API_KEY`, `POSTMILL_CONTAINER`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTMILL_OAUTH_*`). The old names are no longer read.
- **Docker / self-hosting (BREAKING)** — image is now `ghcr.io/reaatech/postmill-app`; compose
  services/network/volumes and the Postgres role/db renamed `postiz-*` → `postmill-*`. The Postgres
  **data** volume (`postgres-volume`) is unchanged, so data persists. See *"Migrating from a
  Postiz-branded deployment"* in [Upgrading](./self-hosting/upgrading.md).
- **Internal identifiers** — the Mastra chat agent id (`postiz` → `postmill`) and memory store
  (`postiz-store` → `postmill-store`) were renamed, which **orphans persisted chat memory** (one-time
  reset). MCP server name + setup snippets, OpenTelemetry tracer (`postmill-ai`), and the C2PA media
  claim generator were rebranded too.
- **Legal/governance** — product name rebranded in LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING/CCLA/ICLA/SECURITY (original
  copyright + AGPL preserved); `SECURITY.md` scope/reporting retargeted to `reaatech/postmill-app`.

**Intentionally not changed:** website/domain URLs (`*.postiz.com`, pending the new site), the
`npm install -g postiz` CLI snippets (pending CLI publish under the new name), internal translation
keys, and the `@gitroom/*` TypeScript path aliases.

## v3.6.0 — User profile, per-tenant storage/OAuth/AI, media manager, datatable rebuilds

The settings surface is fundamentally reorganized: admin-only pages are gone, and every org manages
its own storage, channel OAuth credentials, and AI provider configuration from the settings sidebar.

### User-facing features
- **User profile page** (`/settings/profile`) with Profile (avatar/name/bio), Security (password change),
  and Notifications (email prefs) tabs.
- **Settings re-tabbed** — Settings, Profile, Teams, Channels, AI, Brand, Media, Storage, Webhooks,
  Auto Post, Sets, Signatures, Developers, Approved Apps. Admin routes are removed.
- **Teams datatable** — search, sort, paginate, invite, and create users inline.
- **Webhooks datatable** — educational header, test ping, event selection, HMAC signing.
- **Auto Post / Sets / Signatures datatables** — educational empty states and proper CRUD.
- **Media manager** — folder tree, file details panel, bulk actions, search/sort/pagination, tags,
  descriptions, **trash & restore** (soft-delete + recovery).
- **Campaigns page** — educational header + aggregate stats row.

### Per-tenant infrastructure
- **Storage adapter system** — each org mounts S3/R2/B2/IDrive e2/local disk via `StorageProviderConfig`.
  5 GB default quota per org (`localStorageQuotaBytes`). Four-panel Storage settings tab:
  - **Providers** — cards showing type, mount status, usage
  - **Quota Status** — usage meter with 80%+ warning banner
  - **Usage Breakdown** — pie charts / tables by folder and provider
  - **Audit Log** — all storage operations (mount, unmount, test, migrate, set-default-folder) with
    pagination
- **Storage health tracking** — last-checked timestamp and error messages on each provider card
  (`lastHealthCheck`, `lastHealthError` columns in `StorageProviderConfig`).
- **Folder-level provider routing** — assign a storage provider to a folder; uploads to that folder
  automatically use the assigned provider. Configured via `POST /settings/storage/:id/set-default-folder`,
  stored in `StorageProviderConfig.defaultFolderId`.
- **Per-tenant channel OAuth** — orgs provide their own OAuth app credentials in the Channels tab.
  All per-provider env vars (`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`, `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, etc.) deprecated (kept as
  fallback; ~185 `getEnvOr()` calls to be migrated in subsequent releases).
- **Per-tenant AI provider config** — orgs configure providers/models/keys in the AI tab.
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` deprecated for model resolution (no longer read by `AIModelProvider`;
  deprecation warning logged at boot if set).
- **Brand voice + RAG knowledge base** (Brand tab) — brand voice profiles and content-index UI.
- **Media provider settings** (Media tab) — per-tenant media pipeline config.

### Bugfixes
- Comments inbox: proper error/permission states + `RUN_CRON` banner.
- Analytics v2: dark mode charts (CSS vars) + skeleton loader performance.
- Calendar: card stats and comment badge fixes.

### Schema (additive)
- **New:** `MediaFolder`, `StorageProviderConfig`, `OrgProviderConfiguration`, `AuditLog`.
- **Added columns:** `Media.folderId` (nullable), `Media.tags` (JSON), `Media.description` (text),
  `Media.deletedAt` (soft-delete for trash); `Organization.localStorageQuotaBytes` (default 5 GB);
  `StorageProviderConfig.lastHealthCheck`, `lastHealthError`, `defaultFolderId`; 
  `AIOrgProviderConfig.isActive`.
- **Deprecated** but kept: `ProviderConfiguration`, `AIProviderConfig`, `AISystemSettings`.

### Deprecated env vars (kept as fallback; deprecation warning on boot)
`STORAGE_PROVIDER`, all `CLOUDFLARE_*` vars, all per-provider OAuth env vars, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## v3.5.10 — Stabilization release

Gets v3.5.9 **actually booting** (it shipped with six chained boot blockers that returned 502 on
every `/api/*`) and closes a batch of UI/API bugs found by a comprehensive end-to-end Playwright
audit of the real interface. No schema changes.

### Boot & deploy reliability
- Lockfile regenerated so `node-telegram-bot-api` resolves to the CommonJS `0.66.x` the code targets
  (the drifted lockfile had pinned an ESM-only `1.0.0-rc.0` that crash-looped the backend).
- Five further runtime boot crashes fixed (DI on `ProviderHealthService` / `IdempotencyFactory`,
  path-to-regexp v8 wildcard routes, the orchestrator's `AiModule`/`RagService` wiring, and a
  `crypto` import banned in the Temporal workflow sandbox).
- New CI **boot guard** rejects lockfile drift and boots the backend against ephemeral Postgres+Redis
  — the check that would have stopped v3.5.9 from shipping un-booted.

### UI/API fixes
- Composer can save/schedule/publish again (lenient validate DTO on `/posts/valid` + `/preflight`).
- CopilotKit stops 403-ing on every page (forwards the CSRF token to its runtime).
- `/analytics/v2` no longer crashes — the line chart was missing its Chart.js `type`, so it threw and tripped the page's error boundary ("Something went wrong").
- Billing no longer **logs you out of the whole app**: on instances without Stripe, the pricing-tiers call hit Stripe with a placeholder key and got `401 "Invalid API Key"`; the frontend force-logs-out on any `401`, so opening Billing silently logged you out — making every admin page and Settings render as login. `getPackages()` now returns empty tiers (never a 401) when Stripe is unconfigured.
- `agent-media-sso` degrades gracefully when unconfigured.

### Completeness & accessibility
- **Team management**: change a member's role and view a member's profile (was list + remove only).
- **Admin errors**: Retry a failed post (re-queues it) and Resolve/dismiss an error from `/admin/errors`.
- Settings tabs and the admin channel-config row are now keyboard-focusable semantic buttons.
- Global API throttle default raised `90 → 600`/hour (`API_LIMIT`) so normal interactive use no longer
  trips it and renders pages blank on 429.

## v3.5.9 — Bugfix & UI-completeness release

A comprehensive bugfix and UI-wiring release following a 56-item codebase audit. Focuses on closing
cross-org security gaps, fixing runtime bugs, re-wiring disconnected UI surfaces, and hardening
validation and type safety.

### Security & org isolation
- All campaign update/delete operations now require `organizationId` in the WHERE clause.
- Watchlist account mutations (update, soft-delete, error management) now scoped to org.
- Bulk comment mark-read (`POST /posts/inbox/bulk-read`) requires org ownership.
- Comment assignment verifies post belongs to requesting user's org before reassigning.
- All five campaign endpoints (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE`) now carry `@CheckPolicies` and org scoping.
- Sensitive post reads (`getPost`, `getPostById`, `getPostsByGroup`) now require mandatory `orgId`.
- `POST /posts/bulk` now gated by `@CheckPolicies([..., Sections.POSTS_PER_MONTH])`.

### Runtime fixes
- `GET /posts/inbox` now resolves correctly (controller registration order fixed).
- Calendar stats footer renders for all published posts.
- `metric.component.tsx` no longer crashes on missing `timezones-list` package.
- Calendar grid uses timezone-aware `newDayjs` for correct date display.
- 4 event listener memory leaks fixed (icons, html, support, new-modal components).
- Helmet middleware condition corrected (`||` → `&&`).
- CopilotKit budget check logic clarified.

### Data & performance
- `disableIntegrations()` replaced per-row `update()` loop with single `updateMany()`.
- `getComments()` now filters soft-deleted rows (`deletedAt: null`).
- `getBestTimePosts()` pagination now has deterministic id tiebreaker.
- `useCredit()` wrapped in `$transaction()` to prevent race conditions.
- Comment sync loop guarded against null `result.comments`.

### Validation hardening
- 10 new validations: cursor date parsing, array size limits, enum status values,
  campaign date ordering, watchlist handle format, query parameter whitelists,
  and null guards on comment status.
- 11 AI user endpoints now throttled at 30 req/min.

### Feature / contract fixes
- `campaignId` added to `CreatePostDto` and threaded through `createPost`/`bulkCreate`.
- Image moderation de-scoped to text-only (image params removed from endpoint).
- `CommentStatus` const enum introduced; hardcoded string arrays replaced.
- `any` types in social comments service replaced with proper `Integration` type.
- TTS generation error handling added (BudgetExceeded/GuardrailViolation patterns).

### UI wiring
- Sidebar now includes "Administration" section for super-admins.
- User profile form (name, bio, picture) wired into settings.
- User avatar dropdown menu added to top navigation bar.
- `SetTimezone` component uncommented in app layout.
- Billing address element, notification component, and FAQ heading uncommented.
- Dead TikTok validity reference removed.
- Admin dashboard page created at `/admin/dashboard`.
- Read-only "Media Providers" panel added to Brand & AI settings (`GET /ai/media-providers`).
- "Summarize comments" button added to comment composer.

## v3.5.0 — Security hardening + feature expansion

A codebase-hardening and feature-expansion release. Every change is additive or a refactor under
existing contracts — no breaking changes, no schema renames.

**Security & infrastructure hardening**

- **SSRF-safe outbound dispatch** — a single `safeFetch` helper (validate + manual redirect
  re-validation via `ssrfSafeDispatcher`) now fronts all webhook dispatch and user-influenced
  provider fetches, closing blind-SSRF / DNS-rebinding / redirect-to-metadata holes.
- **Encryption at rest** — versioned AES-GCM `EncryptionService` (`v2:` prefix); `Integration.token`
  / `refreshToken` are now encrypted, with transparent legacy-plaintext read fallback. Optional
  dedicated `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, falling back to `JWT_SECRET`.
- **Response headers & PII scrubbing** — helmet (HSTS, CSP, noSniff, frameguard) plus a Sentry
  `beforeSend`/`beforeBreadcrumb` scrubber that strips auth headers, cookies, tokens, and PII. CSRF
  middleware on cookie-authenticated mutating routes. All bypass under `NOT_SECURED` (dev-only).
- **Throttle guard fix** — the throttler now applies its default limit to all routes (most routes
  previously bypassed it), so per-route `@Throttle` caps actually take effect.
- **OAuth 2.0 / PKCE hardening**, JWT algorithm pinning + expiry/renewal, CSPRNG IDs, open-redirect
  allowlisting (`INTEGRATION_RETURN_URL_ALLOWLIST`), bounded analytics query validation, and a
  multipart-upload ownership ledger.
- **CI** — a `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` workflow on PRs and weekly.

**New feature surfaces**

- **Analytics** — best-time-to-post heatmap (`/analytics/v2/best-time`), recommendations action tab
  (`/analytics/v2/recommendations`), competitor watchlist CRUD (`/analytics/v2/watchlist`), and a 60s
  Redis cache on the overview endpoint.
- **AI utilities** — hashtag generator, content-compliance checker, comment sentiment/summary modes,
  and brand-memory (RAG) index/search — all rate-limited.
- **Composer** — content-QA preflight (`/posts/preflight`) and bulk/CSV scheduling (`/posts/bulk`).
- **Social** — cross-channel comment inbox (`/posts/inbox`), first-comment and poll support gated on
  a new provider **capability matrix** (`/provider-capabilities`).
- **Campaigns** — campaign folders (`/campaigns`) grouping posts/assets/analytics/comments.
- **Webhooks** — new event types: `comment.new`, `comment.reply`, `analytics.snapshot_complete`.

See [API overview](./api/overview.md), [Data model](./reference/data-model.md), and the
[developer architecture notes](./developers/architecture.md).

## v3.4.0 — Pluggable AI provider system

The AI layer is now an admin-configurable, governed, multi-provider system that replaces the single
hardcoded OpenAI integration.

- **25 providers** — 13 direct model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Meta
  Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, Qwen, MiniMax, Azure OpenAI) plus 12
  multi-model hubs & gateways (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway,
  Together AI, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, SiliconFlow, Lightning AI, GMI Cloud, Bitdeer, Vultr).
- **Admin AI Settings** at `/admin/ai` — pick provider/model, store encrypted credentials, test the
  connection, set the active provider, and configure governance.
- **Governance** — input/output guardrails (prompt-injection, PII, brand safety, NSFW), per-scope
  budgets with threshold alerts, OpenTelemetry GenAI telemetry, and provider-health tracking.
- **Backward compatible** — with no admin AI config, behaviour is byte-for-byte the same as today's
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` path. Setting the active provider to none reverts every AI surface to the env
  fallback.

See [AI settings admin](./admin/ai-settings.md).

## v3.3.0 — Calendar, post detail & social comments

- Clicking a calendar card **body** opens a new **Post Detail** modal (KPI header + post thread);
  the edit modal now opens from a settings icon on the card's hover strip.
- A scheduled/published pill and a card stats footer (views/likes/comments) are sourced from
  persisted post snapshots.
- Foundation for **social comments** — synced platform comments, per-user read state, and a
  Temporal sync workflow (gated by `RUN_CRON`).

## v3.2.0 — Three extra providers (36 channels)

Adds **Tumblr** (OAuth2, NPF posts), **Pixelfed** (instance URL + access token, Mastodon-compatible),
and **PeerTube** (instance URL + login, single-video uploads). No database migration required.

## v3.1.0 — Persisted analytics dashboard

Replaces single-channel live-fetch analytics with a persisted multi-channel dashboard. Daily metric
snapshots are collected by a Temporal workflow (requires `RUN_CRON=true` on one orchestrator
instance) and served through `/analytics/v2` with real period-over-period comparisons, charts, and
CSV/JSON export. Daily snapshots roll up to weekly after ~18 months; per-post snapshots prune after
90 days (both windows env-configurable). See [Temporal & background jobs](./self-hosting/temporal-and-cron.md).

## v3.0.0 — Database-backed provider configuration

Channel OAuth/API credentials are managed through an admin UI at `/admin/channels` instead of
environment variables, and are encrypted at rest. Environment variables remain a fallback: with no
DB configs present, providers fall back to `process.env`. A one-time migration script imports
existing env credentials into the database. See [Channels admin](./admin/channels.md).

---

### v3.6.0 — Per-tenant credentials, media manager, data migration helpers

Credentials for channel OAuth, AI providers, and storage backends moved from environment variables
to the database, with per-tenant isolation. All deprecated env vars are auto-migrated on first boot:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `AIOrgProviderConfig` (one per org)
- Channel OAuth env vars (`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`, `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, etc.) → `OrgProviderConfiguration`
- Storage env vars (`CLOUDFLARE_*`, `STORAGE_PROVIDER`) → `StorageProviderConfig`

The media manager was rebuilt with folder tree, tags, bulk actions, search, and drag-and-drop between
folders. Files can be migrated between storage providers from the Storage settings tab.

A channel health dashboard shows per-provider connection status with expiry warnings.
An onboarding checklist guides first-time users through initial setup.
The admin section (`/admin/*`) was deleted — all settings are now tenant-scoped.

---

## Backward compatibility commitments

This fork is run in production. Two invariants are deliberately preserved:

1. **Legacy public analytics route** — the original public API analytics route keeps its response
   shape for n8n/Zapier/Make compatibility; a parallel v2 route was added rather than changing it.
2. **Schema changes are additive** — new tables, nullable-or-defaulted columns. The `db push` model
   never drops or renames columns without a manual backfill plan.
